      <description>I am a junior professor at the Group for Neural Theory at Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris . I am interested in how different brain regions coordinate for flexible motor control.
Training : I received a PhD in applied mathematics at the University of Washington in Seattle (in Eric Shea Brown&amp;rsquo;s lab) where my dissertation focused on how correlated neural activity impacts population coding. I then joined Angus Silver&amp;rsquo;s lab in University College London to study the cerebellum and get my hands dirty with large-scale data analysis.</description>

      <description>Since 2020, I am a postdoc with Alex Cayco Gajic at the Group for Neural Theory. Before that, I obtained my PhD from the Universitat de Barcelona, Spain, where I worked with Albert Compte to understand how NMDA receptor dysfunction affects working memory by altering prefrontal attractor dynamics.
In my postdoc, I am diving into the fields of motor learning and naturalistic behavior, the cerebellum, and how the cerebellum interacts with the neocortex to guide behavior and learning.</description>

      <description>I am currently doing a PhD under the co-supervision of Boris Gutkin and Alex Cayco-Gajic at ENS Paris. My thesis focuses on modelling rapid synchronisation of interneurons in the cerebellum.</description>

      <description>I am a research assistant at the Group for Neural Theory at Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris . I have interests at the interface between Computational Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence.
I performed my Bachelor internship in the laboratory of Luca Berdondini at Italian Institute of Technology on large-scale neural recordings, spike sorting, and clustering. My Master thesis focused on Stochastic Gradient Descent methods for training Recurrent Neural Networks inspired by findings in the cerebellum and it was supervised by Vincent Hakim at LPENS.</description>

      <description>I am a Ph.D. in the Group of Neural Theory at ENS in Paris. I am currently working on probing the Cerebello-cortical loop during motor learning and behavior through Machine Learning and Mathematical techniques.Before it, I was a research assistant in the group of Andrea Calimera, EDA, Politecnico di Torino, working in Machine learning techniques application on predictive mainenance in the MADEin4 and R3-PowerUP European Projects, and on development of Neural Network properties verification algorithms.</description>
